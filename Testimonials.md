“great customer service”
- Chomsky

“the appointment time was kept. the serviceman was courteous, knowledgeable and throughout. his recommendations were appropriate and they followed up promptly.”
- Chomsky

“The salesman took the time to explain several options and there was no hard sell. The installers were prompt, efficient, polite and cleaned up after the installation.”
- KathyB

“I originally contacted Air Master for maintenance because I had a coupon -- that coupon was certainly lucky for me. The technicians are skilled and polite, and they're careful about cleaning up after doing installation or maintenance. When I bought my new furnace and air conditioner last fall, the sales rep discussed options without pressure. I've often recommended this company.”
- MEC0

“We had only positive experiences with AirMaster. We would highly recommend them.”
- Jacie

“This dealer made sure that this new AC unit was the size our home needed. Installation went very well as the workers were polite and efficient. This unit cools our home nicely and the lowered electricity bills are a big plus.”
-Timvetsorg

“In the fall of 2013 we were a repeat customer of Air Master Heating & Cooling. In our former home they had previously installed a furnace & air conditioning unit and when we realized the furnace in our new home was 29 years old, they were the company we called to replace our heating & air conditioning units.
	During the process our sales representative educated us on the different furnace & AC options and helped us make the best decision for our home. We couldn't be more pleased with our selection as it heats our home well and we have a consistent temperature through the entire house (and expect we'll have the same result when it is time to turn on the AC).
	We will continue to recommend Air Master to our family and friends.”

“Mike, Laurie asked that I email you with my experience with your company after the flood. 
Only issue, and probably was me as much or more then you folks, is not understanding that the recommendation was to replace the furnace. 
	The actual install process went well starting with Eric. He is the one who explained why the replace recommendation. When asked how much he was able to talk to Jeff Fry and get a quote while I was on the phone. Then the surprise, when I asked when they could do the install I was told the furnace was in the warehouse and could do next day. I figured it would be several weeks and I am sure I was one of the lucky ones. The "Jerry and Jerry" team came the next day and by lunch time had the old out and the new in, tested and any mess cleaned up. Not only were they quick but did a great job in my opinion. (What else from AirMaster?) You have two keepers there in my opinion.  Jerry just came this last week to do the fall maintenance and was just as good with that as with the install and seems to know his way around the Lennox thermostat. Jerry is welcome in my house for maintenance anytime. Not all of the techs seem comfortable with the thermostat. New technology and not everyone is comfortable with how these work, I am sure, especially folks who don't use the new technology with devices they own, such as smart phones.
So I cannot think of anything that could have been done better or differently. I always expect the best from your company and you folks have never disappointed.  Would recommend your company without any hesitation.
	Feel free to ask for any additional info.
	Forgot to say a big thanks to Laurie as well.  She got the paper work done quickly and we have received our rebate from Lennox and an email from Consumers that our rebate has been approved but have not received the check yet.”

“I would like to ask that you share my next comments with the owner of AirMaster and the rest of the crew who worked on my install. It was a great pleasure working with you and your staff. Your patience and willingness to listen to the special concerns I had about my install was greatly appreciated. The fact that you and your staff went "above and beyond" to come up with an appropriate line cover, represents how customer-centric your company is. Each of your staff exhibited a great sense of professionalism in every aspect of the project. And were always willing to answer my questions in laymen's terms that even I could understand.
	Again, thank you for making this project such a pleasant experience.”

“Hello Michael,
	I worked with you in 2009 to help sell 4th Street in Royal Oak. It was a tough market however I enjoyed working with you to get the home sold.
	I have recently bought a house in Birmingham and contacted your company for a new furnace and AC. I would like to tell you what great costumer service I have had thus far! You have very professional and extremely educated employees. Laurie was great at explaining what our new house would need for both heating and cooling the home. Next Tuesday is my installation date of both the AC and Furnace!!
	I will be referring your company to all my clients as well. I hope you are doing well and If you should have any real estate questions please feel free to contact me.
	Have a great day!”
